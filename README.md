###By PyAreSquare.

## About 📝
This is a GUI (Graphical User Interface) version of the simple and well-known guess the number.

## Controlls 🕹️
Press 'reset the game.' to reset the game. (this will make the computer choose a different number)

Press 'guess the number!' to submit your guess. every time you press this, the number of tires will increase by 1.

## Easter Eggs 🥚
### I don't know if i will add more in the future

if you create a file called 
```
max.txt in the assets directory
```
and give it an integer value like 1000, then 
the next time you start the game (or hit reset) the maximum value (the largest number that the computer caan randomly pick) will be set to that
amount. 

If you change the contents in 
```
max.txt in assets
```
to anything but an integer and then reset the game, the bottom line
will say 'stop messing with me.'
