guess the number (gui) game 1.0
by pyaresquare

a simple gui version of the well-known guess the number
game. 

press 'reset the game.' to reset the game (this will make the computer choose a different number)
press 'guess the number!' to submit your guess. every time you press this, the number of tires will increase by 1

easter egg(s):
(i don't know if i will add more in the future)
if you create a file called 'max.txt' in the assets folder and give it an integer value like 1000, then 
the next time you start the game (or hit reset) the maximum value (or difficulty) will be set to that
amount. 

if you change the contents in max.txt to anything but an integer and then reset the game, the bottom line
will say 'stop messing with me.'
